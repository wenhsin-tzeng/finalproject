      <h4>TNS D<em>4</em>NCE <em>life</em> is a student organization that welcomes all New School students who hold an interest in dance.</h4>
      <div class="bodytext"><p>We offer classes of hiphop, jazz, contemporary, freestyle, and kpop dances. All classes are taught by student-members who have several years of dance experience and are qualified by the rest of the group to teach. However if you already hold a deep foundation in dancing before coming to TNS, you are more than welcomed to sign up to become one of our dance teachers or choreographers after a small audition. Most events and workshops are held after school hours. We hold a casual gathering every Thursday afternoon, offering food and drinks, for members to get to know each other better. There is one big dance performance every semester, and members are encouraged to team up to perform on stage.</p>
      <p><em>Everyone is welcomed here!</em> Don’t worry if you don’t have any experience, come here and meet some of the nicest, warmest, and most talented people in TNS.</p>
